        <h2>The Basic Language of the Web: HTML</h2>
        <p>All modern websites and web applications are built using three <em>fundamental</em> technologies: HTML, CSS and JavaScript.

        <p> In this post, let's focus on HTML. We will learn what HTML is all about, and why you too should learn it.</p>
        <h3>What is HTML?</h3>
        <p>HTML stands for <strong>H</strong>yper<strong>Text</strong> <strong>M</strong>arkup <strong>L</strong>anguage. It's a markup language that web developers use to structure and describe the content of a webpage (not a programming language).</p>   
        <p>HTML consists of elements that describe different types of content: paragraphs, links, headings, images, video, etc. Web browsers understand HTML and render HTML code as websites.</p>
        <h2>Why should you learn HTML?</h2>

        <p> Here are 5 of them:</p>

            To impress friends
            To have fun ðŸ˜ƒ</p>
